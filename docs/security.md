# EmotiBot Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the EmotiBot application to protect user data and ensure secure communication.

## Authentication and Authorization

### JWT-Based Authentication

EmotiBot uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication:

1. **Token Generation**: When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated with the following claims:
   - `sub`: User ID
   - `username`: Username
   - `email`: Email address
   - `iat`: Issued at timestamp
   - `exp`: Expiration timestamp

2. **Token Validation**: All protected API endpoints verify the JWT token before processing requests.

3. **Token Expiration**: JWTs expire after a configurable period (default: 1 hour) to limit the window of opportunity for token theft.

### Password Security

1. **Password Hashing**: User passwords are never stored in plain text. EmotiBot uses the PBKDF2-SHA256 algorithm for password hashing with:
   - Random salt generation for each password
   - Configurable number of iterations to increase computational cost

2. **Password Policies**: (To be implemented)
   - Minimum length requirements
   - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
   - Password reuse prevention

## API Security

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated before processing:

1. **Data Type Validation**: Ensuring inputs match expected types
2. **Sanitization**: Removing potentially dangerous characters or sequences
3. **Size Limits**: Enforcing appropriate size limits on all inputs

### Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, EmotiBot implements rate limiting:

1. **Request Limiting**: Maximum of 100 requests per minute per IP address
2. **Failed Login Limiting**: (To be implemented) Progressive delays after failed login attempts

### CSRF Protection

To prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery:

1. **Token-Based Authentication**: Using JWT tokens instead of cookies prevents CSRF
2. **Same-Origin Policy**: Enforcing same-origin policy for sensitive operations

## Data Protection

### Data in Transit

1. **TLS Encryption**: All communication between clients and the server is encrypted using TLS
2. **Secure Headers**: Implementation of security headers:
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options

### Data at Rest

1. **Sensitive Data Encryption**: (To be implemented) Encryption of sensitive user data in the database
2. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collecting necessary information to provide the service

## Threat Modeling

### Identified Threats

1. **Authentication Bypass**:
   - Mitigation: Robust token validation, secure token generation, proper expiration

2. **Data Exposure**:
   - Mitigation: TLS encryption, proper access controls, data minimization

3. **Injection Attacks**:
   - Mitigation: Input validation, parametrized queries, output encoding

4. **Denial of Service**:
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, resource quotas, monitoring

### Security Testing

1. **Regular Penetration Testing**: (To be implemented) Regular security testing to identify vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency Scanning**: (To be implemented) Automated scanning for vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

1. **Privacy Policy**: Clear and accessible privacy policy
2. **Data Access**: User ability to access their own data
3. **Data Deletion**: User ability to delete their account and data
4. **Data Portability**: User ability to export their data in a common format

## Security Roadmap

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Adding additional authentication factors
2. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Implementing systems to detect and respond to suspicious activities
3. **Security Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for security incidents
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Scheduled comprehensive security reviews
